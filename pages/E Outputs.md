## Level 1 - Outputs
### Lecture
Now, the microcontroller and its sensors are implemented and we basically have created a data logger. In essence, our flight computer is now able to interpret its environment. However, it can not yet intervene in its environment. The flight computer might notice that it unstable by 30Â° in the yaw axis. However, it has no way of changing those circumstances yet. This is where the flight computer's outputs come into play. 
## Level 2 - RGB LED
The first and easiest output to setup is an LED. An LED can be helpful in flight computers for visual indication to the user. We can use an LED to show that the board is powered on, we could use an LED that to indicate the current flight state, and much more.

As you already know an LED is a diode that emits light if current is flowing through it in forward-bias. Remember that a LED also has a reverse-bias in which stops to be conductive. If the threshold voltage of a diode is overcome it becomes conductive in its forward bias. The voltage at which the LED emits light is called the forward voltage. 

The forward voltage varies on the color of the LED. 
A red LED has a forward voltage of 
1.8-2.2V, 
a green one of 2-3V
and a blue one of 3-3.5V.
Those are only typical values and the LEDs generally exist in many different forms. 

### LED
Now what would happen if we connected one of those LEDs to our 3.3V source in forward-bias?
Let's assume we have a red LED with a forward voltage of 2V. 
The LED becomes conductive wand wants to have a voltage drop of 2V across it. However, as we applied 3.3V, the remaining 1.3V must be dropped somewhere in the circuit according to the Kirchhoff's voltage law. As there is no other component, the excess voltage must be dropped across its internal resistance ESR, which is very low. This would lead to a very high current, overheating of the diode, and finally destruction of the diode. 

$I = \dfrac{V_{excess}}{R_{LED}}$

To make the schematic work on the long-term we have to limit this current. 
This is done my a current limiting resistor. 
Every LED also gives a maximum rated current that is often between 5 to 20mA. 
Many LEDs operate across the current range. Generally, the higher the current the brighter the LED. So, we know that the voltage across the resistor must be 1.3V and we want to have current of 10mA. With those two parameters we are able to directly calculate the resistor.

$R_{lim} = \dfrac{V_{excess}}{I_{LED}}$

If we want to control the LEDs with our microcontroller, we can hook their anode to one of its GPIO pins. If we toggle the GPIO, a voltage of 3.3V is applied to the LED and the LED lights up. 
##### RGB LED 
An LED type that is even more useful for model rocket applications, is the RGB LED. RGB stands for the colors red, green, and blue. It is a widely used color scheme, as every other color except black can be created with those three colors if their proportions are varied accordingly. If all three LEDs are at the same brightness, the color white is created. If red and green light up we get yellow. There are color wheels online that can show you the exact ratios to create any colors you want. 

An RGB LED houses those three LEDs in a single package. Its implementation is basically the same, as the implementation of a single LED, but the process repeated thrice. And as every color has a different voltage drop we have to calculate the current limiting resistor for all three separately. 
##### Low-side Driver
When driving the LEDs with the microcontroller we have to be aware of the maximum current ratings of the microcontroller's GPIO pins. 
The ESP32 can provide up to 40mA per single pin, which is more than enough to directly drive an LED. The STM32F7 allows for up to 25mA per single pin, which is also sufficient to provide LEDs with power.

However, the Teensy 4.1 only allows for 10mA per pin. In this case, we would have either to reduce the brightness and the current of the LED, or we have to figure out another way of powering the LED without damaging the microcontroller. An easy way would be to interpose a BJT transistor with which we then turn on the LED. 

But, there are also special components to do the job, so called driver ICs. 
A very famous one the ULN2003A, is basically a transistor array, which allows to control high currents with low-current control signals. It basically consists of 7 outputs that can be controlled individually. There are two kinds of driver ICs low-side and the high-side drivers.
A low-side driver interposes the circuit between the load and the GND, while a high-side driver interposes between the source and the load. The low side driver is easier to control, as the gate of the transistor is referenced to the GND signal. So, it is easier to interface from microcontrollers. 
The ULN2003A is also a low-side driver IC.

Another advantage of a low-side driver is that different components can be connected to different source voltages. When implementing the ULN2003A, we have to connect the common ground. The control signals on the one side and the loads with their source voltages on the other side. 
Further, we have to keep in mind that the BJT transistors inside the driver, have a voltage drop of 0.9V @100mA. We have to take this voltage drop into account when calculating the current limiting resistor! The ULN2003A is able to source 500mA per channel and a total of 2.5A for the entire IC. If we need to control a device with more than 500mA, we can simple unite two channels which doubles the allowed current flow. 

If we were to switch inductive loads, we have to connect the COM port of the IC. When the Darlington transistor switches off, the inductive load attempts to maintain current flow, which can cause a voltage spike. The freewheeling diode, connected between the load and the COM pin, allows this current to continue flowing in a loop, preventing the voltage spike from damaging the transistor or other components in the circuit. 
## Level 3 - Buzzer
While the LED provide visual confirmation, a Buzzer provides acoustic information. 
There are different types of buzzers, but one common type is the electromagnetic buzzer, which 
works based on the principle of electromagnetic induction. 
It consist of a coil (the electromagnet), a diaphragm with a permanent magnet, and a housing. 

When the electromagnet is energized, it creates a magnetic field that attracts or repels the diaphragm, causing it to move. This movement of the diaphragm creates a soundwave that we can hear. To create this movement, an electrical signal (usually an alternating current or a pulsating direct current) is applied to the coil. The faster the speed of the movement the higher the note that is produced. 

There are two types of buzzer as components that can be bought. There active and passive (or externally driven) buzzers. The active buzzer already incorporates an IC inside its enclosure that creates an alternating electric signal that causes the membrane to move in its resonance frequency. Active buzzer must only be connected to a steady DC voltage of, for example, 3.3V and then the begin to sound. As those buzzers feature the drive circuit internally, their notes can not be controlled. 

Then there are passive buzzers. Those have to be controlled externally, and feature no internal IC. Through that we can vary the alternating frequency and, therefore, the note it produces. We control those externally driven buzzers by pulsing DC current. The pulsing method commonly used is PWM, which we will look at later in this Level when we discuss servo control. 

Regarding the implementation of the buzzer, we do not have to take many things into account. We do not need a current limiting resistor. When selecting, we have to look at its decibel rating, so we can chose a buzzer with a sufficient loudness, and we have to look at its current draw to determine whether or not we have to use a low-side driver. 

## Level 4 - Pyro Channels
One of the most important outputs on our flight computers are the pyro channels. Those are needed to control pyrotechnic devices such as heating wires and electric igniters. Many mechanical systems that we use on our rockets are deployed by heating wires. The deployment via heating wires bears the benefit of forming less complex, lighter, more reliable, and smaller deployment systems. Additionally, the rocket's engines must be able to use electric igniters. These can also be controlled with this system.

When controlling heating wires and electric igniters, the biggest problem that comes into play is that they are causing very high current flows that can be as high as several amps. This means that they cannot be controlled via a standard microcontroller output pin. Additionally, in case of an overload, the microcontroller should be protected from severe damage.

##### Circuit
Therefore, we need to create a specific driving circuit. The circuit is directly powered by the LiPo battery, as the regulated power supplies cannot withstand these high currents, and because minimal voltage differences are not important to the functionality of the application. 

The heating wires and electric igniters are connected to the flight computer by a screw barrier terminal block. In the case of the Stack flight computer their are connected by pluggable terminal blocks, which come of the advantage of being easily accessible when installed in the rocket. 

The source of the battery is connected to one of the two pins of the terminal block, while the other pin is connected to the drain of a N-channel MOSFET. The source of the MOSFET is connected to GND. 
The gate of the MOSFET is pulled down to ground by a 2k resistor. This prevents the pyro channel from accidentally deploying pyro technic devices because of interferences.
Furthermore, these pyro channels feature status LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) that indicate if they are turned on. 

To switch a pyro channel on, the microcontroller sets the output pin high which is connected to the gate of the MOSFET. This creates a voltage difference between the gate and source of the MOSFET, which eventually makes the MOSFET conductive so that current can flow. To ensure that the MOSFET turns on it is important that the voltage difference is larger than the minimal gate source voltage our MOSFET requires. (Vgs = 3V) Further it is important to add a current limiting resistor to the gate of the MOSFET, as the internal capacitance of the MOSFET leads to a current spike when turning it on. This current spike could damage the microcontroller and can be prevented by this resistor. 

The last thing to consider is the current ratings of the MOSFET and the barrier terminal block. Our MOSFET is able to withstand a continuous drain source current of 50A and a drain source voltage of 30V. Its power dissipation rating is 60W, which means that the MOSFET can safely dissipate up to 60 watts of power without overheating or experiencing failure. 

## Level 5 - PWM for Servo
To be able to control the servos that are located inside our thrust vector control system, we have to understand the concept of PWM (pulse width modulation). As we mentioned previously, most microcontrollers are only able to create digital outputs and often do not feature a DAC. Instead they switch the outputs on and off continuously to get a voltage that falls between the maximum 3.3V and 0V. The voltage that is achieved depends on the duty cycle of the signal, which is the ratio of the active time over the total time. To create a steady voltage this signal must than be filtered by adding a capacitor to the circuit. 

In a case of controlling a servo, we use the same principle, but spare the capacitor. 
A servo motor is a type of electric motor that incorporates a potentiometer. The potentiometer, also known as a variable resistor, consists of a rotary component that changes its resistance as it rotates. This rotation is directly linked to the position of the servo motor's output shaft. Through that the servo can accurately control its horn position. Consequently, most servos are limited to a range between -90 and +90 degrees in rotation. The potentiometer within the servo provides feedback to the servo controller, allowing it to adjust the motor's position to match the desired angle specified by the PWM signal. 

Servos have three wires. The power line that requires anything from 4 to 6V, the GND line, and the signal line. On the signal line, we provide the servos with information of what angle it shall target. This information is provided by a PWM signal with a duration of 20ms.
An active period of 1.5ms corresponds to the center position of the servo, so 0Â°.
An active period of 2ms corresponds to plus 90Â°, and an active period of 1ms corresponds to -90Â°. Anything in-between corresponds to the other angle values. Servos interpolate between these extremes based on the pulse width received. For example, a pulse width of 1.75ms corresponds to +45 degrees, while 1.25ms corresponds to -45 degrees. Through alternating the active period, we can indicate which angle the servo should take on.

#### SD Card
Another component that we might consider as output would be an SD card to which we can store our flight data. As we mentioned previously an SD card is basically a Flash storage with a specific form factor. There are micro SD cards and regular SD cards. For most flight computers we will use the micro SD cards to spare PCB space. 

To implement an SD card to our design, we have to add an SD card connector. There two ways in which those connectors hold the SD card in place. In summary, spring-loaded connectors feature a spring mechanism to secure the SD card in place and facilitate easy removal, while pluggable connectors offer a simple, friction-based connection for easy insertion and removal of the SD card without additional locking mechanisms.

When connecting the SD card, we use SPI again. The SD card needs to be powered by 3.3V with an added capacitor of 100nF. 
We connect the 
SCK to CLK
MISO to DAT0, 
MOSI to CMD
and the chip select of the SD card tot he CD or DAT3 pin. 
Through those simple connections the microcontroller can interface the SD card seamlessly.

#### Summary
LEDs are diodes that emit light in forward bias. They have a forward voltage that should drop across them and a rated current. To limit the current, when a voltage that is larger than the forward voltage is applied, a current limiting resistor is interposed. 
RGB LEDs use the three colors red, green, and blue to create any color and are often incorporated into a single package. 

For microcontrollers with too little GPIO output current, a driver IC can be used. The driver IC is basically a transistor array that allows to control high currents with low current microcontroller, while adding protection to the microcontroller. A low-side driver is easiest to use as the gate voltages are referenced to ground, and different source voltages can be on the load side. The transistor is basically interposed between the load and GND, compared to the high-side driver that is interposed between source and the load. 

Buzzers work by an electromagnet that moves a diaphragm. The oscillation of the diaphragm creates sound waves that we are able to hear. The oscillation is either created by an already incorporated IC than the buzzer is an active buzzer. Or we have to create this control signal by PWM, which additionally allows as to alter the pitch. 

Pyro channels are needed to trigger heating wires and electric ignitors. The basically interpose an N-channel MOSFET between the battery source and GND. The heating wires and electric ignitors are connected to a screw terminal that has the battery voltage connected to one pin and the drain of the MOSFET to the other pin. The MOSFET is controlled by a voltage that the microcontroller applies to the gate. It also features a pull-down resistor between gate and source, to prevent accidental power on, and adds a current limiting resistor to the gate to protect the microcontroller. We can add an LED to indicate when the pyro channel is turned. 

Servos are electric motors that feature a potentiometer for closed-loop angle control, and often only have a range of motion of +-90Â°. To control them a PWM signal with a duration of 20ms is supplied. The active region tells the servo which angle it shall target. If its 1ms it should steer to -90, if it's 1.5ms it should reach 0Â°, and if it is 2ms it should target +90Â°.

Finally, an SD card is flash storage that we can interface by SPI to store flight data. There are two types one that secures the SD card by a click (spring-loaded), and ones that secure the SD card by friction.
