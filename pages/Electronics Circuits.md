## This path is work in progress!
The material that we provide in the following levels is by now means complete but it might help you to learn about the subject yourself, while we are working on providing content for you! 

Now that you are familiar with the basics of electronics and some standard components, we can think about how we can arrange them to create functional units that we can use to operate our rockets. 

## Level 1 - System Overview


## Level 2 - Power Management  
### Battery 

### Regulation 
#### Linear Voltage Regulator
#### Switching Regulator
### Charging 

## Level 3 - Microcontroller Implementation
### Breakout vs on-PCB design
### ESP32
### STM32

## Level 4 - Sensors
### Breakout vs on-PCB design
### How to read a datasheet
### Gyroscope and Accelerometer
### Barometer
### Voltmeter

## Level 5 - Outputs

### RGB LED
### Buzzer
### Pyro Channels
### PWM for servo control
