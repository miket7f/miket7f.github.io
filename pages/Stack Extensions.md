## Environment Sensors
- Humidity sensor
- Temperature sensor
- UV sensor for determining UV radiation to assess Ozon layer, levels of radiation for human sun protection. 
- Air quality sensor
- Sound sensor 
- Gas sensor (CO2, CO, N, and VOCs)
- Radiation sensor (Geiger Counter), for gauging exposure for flight computers safety

## Obstacle Avoidance Module
- Ultrasound sensors around the rocket to avoid obstacles in flight. 
- A total of five or six
- One at the rocket top and four looking 45Â° forward on all four rocket sides 
- Maybe an additional one at the rocket rear to detect landing height. 

## Rocket Strains
- Weight cell for thrust measurement
- Photoresistor for mechanisms deployment (heating wire duration, engine ignition, and payload deployment)
- Strain gauges around the rocket interior to gauge mechanical stress on the vehicle.
- Seismometer

## Propulsion Monitor
- Weight cell to gauge thrust
- IMU to measure the engine's orientation 
- Temperature sensors along the engine to measure temperature distribution and change.
- Photoresistor and sound sensor to determine when engine is ignited, as well as burn duration and sound and light profile of the engine. 

## Orientation
- Sun based orientation by using a photoresistor array and real-time data of sun's location relative to the location on Earth. 
- Real-time clock module 

## Biometric Analysis
- Heart rate 
- Oximetry 

## Recording Module 
- Multiple camera attachments: TVC camera, outside camera, payload camera 
- Infrared camera?
- Sound sensor (microphone)
- With image processor?
