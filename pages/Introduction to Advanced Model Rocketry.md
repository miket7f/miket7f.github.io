Witnessing the newest missions of SpaceX, Nasa, and ESA, certainly inspired many people all over the world to become involved in aerospace engineering. 
### Model Rocketry 
However, for most participating in rocketry has long been very difficult to do. As many were either still in high school or already pursued another career. 

In recent years more and more miniaturized solid rocket engines became available all over the world through companies like ESTES, Apogee, or Klima. With those, aerospace enthusiasts were able to launch their own models in their spare time. Through the offering of model rocket engines, a new hobby evolved **Model Rocketry**.

The focus of model rocketry is
- to either buy a readily available model rocket or to physically design your own. 
- to equip them with a proper solid rocket engine. 
- and to come up with ideas on how to successfully recover their models. 

Model rocket enthusiasts usually choose short burning rocket engines over longer burning ones, as this results in a very high thrust to weight ratio. If this ratio is high enough, the rocket flies perfectly stable by adding fins to the rear end of the rocket. This effect is called passive stabilization.  

For recovering the model rockets, parachutes are incorporated. These can be deployed in many different way. One of the most common is to, for example, use the recoil of certain types of engines that release a gas after engine burnout. This gas creates pressure inside the parachute hull, which causes the nose cone to open. 

If the physical design of the rocket is done, the proper engine is selected, and the flight is simulated inside a software environment like Open Rocket. Then, there is nothing more to do, and it is time to launch the rocket.

### Real Rocketry

Conventional model rocketry, is certainly a fun endeavor and relatively easy to do. However, it has almost nothing to do with the real deal.

Real rockets never solely trust upon passive stabilization, as their thrust to weight ratio is quite low at the beginning of the flight. Further, passive stabilization ceases to work in the upper layers of the atmosphere and allows for now active control. 

For a rocket to escape Earth, it must enter Earth's orbit. Orbit insertion can only be done be knowing the orientation, position, and velocity of the vehicle, and by being able to control these parameters actively. 

To do so, electronics system, advanced software, and complex physical systems are incorporated inside each and every launch vehicle. 

### Advanced Model Rocketry
In **advanced model rocketry** the above mentioned concepts are implemented at the miniature scale, enabling aerospace enthusiasts to learn real aerospace concepts at an affordable scale.

In advanced model rocketry the possibilities are endless, and there is no roof which could limit ambitious goals. BPS space, for example, simulated a Falcon Heavy flight with booster separation and active stabilization at the model rocket scale. While BPS space and TTB Aerospace both accomplished a propulsive landing just like SpaceX. Again other build the world's lightest thrust vector control model rocket (JM Space). 

### Activity 1

## Level 2 - Areas of Knowledge
Now we know what advanced model rocketry is all about and that it opens up a whole new dimension of possibilities. 

At the same time, it requires you to acquire a heap of knowledge and different skills to bring your visions to life. The set of skills required can be categorized into four different areas: physical, electronics, and software design, as well as rocket flight. 
### Physical Design
The first skill you need is the ability to bring your concepts to life. 
This is done by using a computer aided design software with which you can create a 3D model of your very own model rocket. 
Inside a CAD design environment you create the aerodynamic shape of the vehicle and design and incorporate all the different mechanisms your rocket needs to succeed. 
This 3D model can then be brought to life by either 3D printing the different parts or by creating a draft for conventional manufacturing of certain parts. 

Here is the 3D model of our model rocket Buffalo L that is aimed at achieving a propulsive landing: 
![](/assets/images/KS®4922013657.54.jpg)
If you want to explore this skill further, then you can go down the physical design path of Rocketree, where you will learn everything you need to design your own mechanisms or rockets. 
### Electronics Design
For a model rocket to be advanced, you certainly will need some sort of electronics system inside your rocket. 

This electronics system will gather flight data and control the rocket's mechanisms.
At its very basics you could use a Arduino based microcontroller and a breakout board to make your first flight computer. 

However, when rocket models become more advanced, a printed circuit board (PCB) design is required. 
And this will be another skill that you have to acquire. 

To design your own PCB you will have to learn about 
- the different electronics components
- how to create your own circuits and schematics
- the layout of your PCB
- and the routing of PCB traces 

The finished PCB design, can be ordered online at an affordable price point.

To get an idea of what such a flight computer might look like we have provided a picture of Buffalo Rev. E - our flight computer that has successfully flown on our Buffalo L rocket:

In the electronics design path you will learn about the basic concepts of PCB design, and at the end you will be able to design your own extension board for the Rocketree flight computer. 

### Software Design 
Further, you need to give the hardware a set of instructions, so it can operate accordingly. 
For that you will have to create code. 
This is probably the most difficult aspect of advanced model rocketry, as there is no limit to what your rocket could be able to do.

There are many different programming languages and environment with which you can give your hardware the instructions it needs.

If you want to create your own instructions, then the software design path is the route to choose. 

At the beginning you will learn about the different programming environments with which you can program our devices, and then the path splits into sensor and control theory. 

In the sensor theory path, you will learn about the function principles of the utilized sensors and how the information of them is gathered and processed. 

In the control theory path, on the other hand, you will learn how to use this data that we acquire from our sensors to control our rocket according to our needs. You will learn about the basics, such as a state machine and PID control. 

### Rocket Flight
Finally, you will have to be aware of certain aerospace concepts when launching model rockets. 

You will have to learn about the flight mechanics. So, you know which forces act on your vehicle and you want to know the difference between passive and active stabilization.

When launching a rocket, you will also have to learn about safety procedures and flight preparations. 

After you have launched a rocket, you want to know how you can analyze your flights. So, you can improve their performance for the better. 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2pJX37a3xG8?si=lkFb2OVsGc7qsmWE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

If you want to learn about flight dynamics, launch your a model rocket, and analyze your flight performance, then you should go down the rocket flight path.

## Level 3 - Getting to know the hardware

To make the use of Rocketree most convenient we provide you with products that make the start into advanced model rocketry more seamless.

For each path and skill that follows you will build upon our products. 
If, for example, you want to focus on software design, you will need a flight computer to program.
If, on the other hand, you want to get insights into launching rockets, then you will need a physical model, a flight computer, and the according software. 
By using our products you can focus on the skill you want to develop, without having to create all aspects of advanced model rocketry yourself. 

We provide you with 
- our flight computer system **Rocketree Stack**
- our flight software **Rocketree OS**
- our post-flight analysis tool **Rocketree Studio**
- and our rocket **Buffalo**

As you will work with those products, a lot, we want to briefly introduce you to them.
### Rocketree Stack
Rocketree Stack is our newest flight computer system. 
A flight computer has to carry out many different tasks, and most often those are united on a single PCB. However, our design is highly modular and splits the tasks across three or more different boards.

Buffalo Stack:

One module runs the main flight software and handles telemetry, another one provides readily processed sensor data, and yet another controls the outputs.

Resulting in
- Rocketree CORE (upper module)
- Rocketree FUSION (middle module)
- Rocketree OUT (lower module)
### Rocketree CORE
![](/assets/images/Buffalo%20Stack%20-%20Core.81.jpg)Rocketree CORE is always required. It is powered by a LiPo battery and features the power management for the entire flight computer system. Further, it bears functionality to store flight data and embeds connectivity.
### Rocketree FUSION
![](/assets/images/Buffalo%20Stack%20%20-%20Fusion.82.jpg)Then, there is Rocketree  FUSION. Its task is to perform reliable state estimation and provide accurate position, velocity and attitude estimates to the CORE board for flight decisions and TVC.

We achieve this by fusing IMU and barometer data in real-time using state-of-the-art sensor fusion algorithms. We also plan on incorporating GNSS signals into future versions of this board to facilitate longer flights with larger horizontal deviations from the launch site.

The fusion module operates in different modes to fit the varying circumstances during different stages of the flight. E.g., in stationary mode, when the rocket sits still on the launch pad, the accelerometer is used to estimate the rocket’s attitude based on earth’s gravity since it is free of drift. However, during flight, gravity is not the only force acting on the rocket. So, attitude is primarily determined by integrating gyroscope readings. To mitigate the effects of drift and to define a reference altitude, all sensors are calibrated before flight.

### Rocketree OUT
![](/assets/images/Buffalo%20Stack%20-%20Out.83.jpg)The third board is the Buffalo OUT. This one incorporates pyro channels to trigger heating wires and electric ignitors, as well as servo ports to control the thrust vector control system.

### Rocketree CONNECT
The boards interface with each other via this stackable header that we call Rocketree CONNECT.
Rocketree CONNECT, supplies battery voltage, regulated 5V, and regulated 3.3V from the CORE board to all the other sub-boards.

Further this connector incorporates the communication interface “the I2C bus” where the CORE board is the MASTER.

A total of 255 FUSION and OUT boards could be added to one CORE board, which makes its use cases almost endless.

Regarding microcontrollers, the CORE board features the ESP32 to allow for Bluetooth and WiFi capabilities.
