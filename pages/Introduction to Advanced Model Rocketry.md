The newest missions of SpaceX, Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic, Rocket Lab, NASA, and ESA inspire many people to become involved in aerospace engineering. I, for example, wanted to study aerospace engineering ever since I saw the side-by-side landing of the Falcon Heavy side boosters during their first test flight. 
### Model Rocketry 
However, for most people, participating in aerospace engineering is very difficult. Many are either in high school or pursuing another career when they discover their aerospace interests. 

Fortunately, the rise of miniaturized solid rocket engines from companies like ESTES, Apogee, and Klima has made it possible for enthusiasts to engage with rocket science in a more accessible way. With them, aerospace enthusiasts can launch miniaturized rockets in their spare time. Through the offering of model rocket engines, a new hobby evolved **Model Rocketry**.

For most, the focus of model rocketry is
- to buy a readily available model rocket or to physically design their own. 
- to equip them with a proper solid rocket engine. 
- and to recover the rocket with the help of a parachute.  

Model rocket enthusiasts usually choose short-burning rocket engines over longer-burning ones to achieve a very high thrust-to-weight ratio. If this ratio is high enough, the rocket flies perfectly stable by only adding fins to the rocket's rear. This effect is called passive stabilization.  

As mentioned, we use parachutes to recover our model rockets, so we don’t have to rebuild them. There are several methods to deploy the parachute, but one of the most common techniques involves using the recoil from certain types of engines that release gas after burnout. This gas creates pressure inside the parachute compartment, causing the nose cone to open and the parachute to deploy. By utilizing the engine’s recoil, we can avoid adding electronics to the model rocket. 

Once we've completed the physical design and selected the appropriate engine, we can simulate the flight using software like Open Rocket. After running the simulation and ensuring everything is in order, it’s time to launch the rocket.

Launching a model rocket is a straightforward process, yet incredibly fun!

### Real Rocketry
Conventional model rocketry is a fun endeavor and relatively easy to do. However, it has almost nothing to do with the real deal.

Real rockets never solely rely on passive stabilization, as their thrust-to-weight ratio is comparably low at the beginning of the flight. Further, passive stabilization ceases to work in the upper layers of the atmosphere as the air density decreases and allows for now active control. 

Finally, for a rocket to escape Earth, it must achieve orbit. Orbit insertion requires precise knowledge of the vehicle's orientation, position, and velocity, and the rocket must be capable of actively controlling these parameters.

To do so, electronic systems, advanced software, and complex physical systems are incorporated inside every launch vehicle. 

### Advanced Model Rocketry
In **advanced model rocketry**, aerospace concepts are applied on a miniature scale, allowing enthusiasts to explore and understand real aerospace principles in a more accessible and affordable way.

In advanced model rocketry, the possibilities are endless, and no roof could limit ambitious goals. BPS Space, for example, simulated a Falcon Heavy flight with booster separation and active stabilization at the model rocket scale; BPS Space and TTB Aerospace accomplished a propulsive landing, just like SpaceX; and our team created an exceptionally lightweight thrust vector-controlled model rocket with a dry mass of only 200 grams and developed one of the first actively stabilized multi-engine rockets.

Achieving these ambitious goals involves integrating electronic, advanced software, and complex physical systems at the model scale. These processes are what advanced model rocketry is all about applying aerospace principles in a miniature form and gaining hands-on experience in the fascinating world of aerospace engineering.

## Level 2 - Areas of Knowledge
Now we know what advanced model rocketry is all about and that it opens up a whole new dimension of possibilities. 

At the same time, it requires you to acquire a heap of knowledge and different skills to bring your visions to life. The set of skills required can be categorized into four different areas: physical, electronics, software design, and rocket flight. 
### Physical Design
The first skill you need is the ability to bring your concepts to life. 
This is done by using a computer aided design software with which you can create a 3D model of your very own model rocket. 
Inside a CAD design environment you create the aerodynamic shape of the vehicle and design and incorporate all the different mechanisms your rocket needs to succeed. 
This 3D model can then be brought to life by either 3D printing the different parts or by creating a draft for conventional manufacturing of certain parts. 

Here is the 3D model of our model rocket Buffalo L that is aimed at achieving a propulsive landing: 
![](/assets/images/KS®4922013657.54.jpg)
If you want to explore this skill further, then you can go down the physical design path of Rocketree, where you will learn everything you need to design your own mechanisms or rockets. 
### Electronics Design
For a model rocket to be advanced, you certainly will need some sort of electronics system inside. 

This electronics system will gather flight data and control the rocket's mechanisms.
At its very basics you could use a Arduino based microcontroller and a breakout board to make your first flight computer. 

However, when rocket models become more advanced, a printed circuit board (PCB) design is required. 
And this will be another skill that you have to acquire. 

To design your own PCB you will have to learn about 
- the different electronics components
- how to create your own circuits and schematics
- and how to bring your circuits to life by using a PCB design software. 

The finished PCB design, can be ordered online at an affordable price point.

To get an idea of what such a flight computer might look like we have provided a picture of Buffalo Rev. E - our flight computer that has successfully flown on our Buffalo L rocket:
![](/assets/images/DSC_0014-2%201.jpg)
In the electronics design path you will learn about the basic concepts of PCB design, and at the end you will be able to design your own extension board for the Rocketree flight computer. 

### Software Design 
Further, you need to give the hardware a set of instructions, so it can operate accordingly. 
For that you will have to create code. 
This is probably the most difficult aspect of advanced model rocketry, as there is no limit to what your rocket could be able to do.

There are many different programming languages and environment with which you can give your hardware the instructions it needs.

If you want to create your own instructions, then the software design path is the route to choose. 

At the beginning you will learn about the different programming environments with which you can program our devices, and then the path splits into sensor and control theory. 

In the sensor theory path, you will learn about the function principles of the utilized sensors and how the information of them is gathered and processed. 

In the control theory path, on the other hand, you will learn how to use this data that we acquire from our sensors to control our rocket according to our needs. You will learn about the basics, such as a state machine and PID control. 

### Rocket Flight
Finally, you will have to be aware of certain aerospace concepts when launching model rockets. 

You will have to learn about the flight mechanics. So, you know which forces act on your vehicle and you want to know the difference between passive and active stabilization.

When launching a rocket, you will also have to learn about safety procedures and flight preparations. 

After you have launched a rocket, you want to know how you can analyze your flights. So, you can improve their performance for the better. 

If you want to learn about flight dynamics, launch a model rocket, and analyze your flight performance, then you should go down the rocket flight path. 
 
### Activity 1
So now that you know what areas of expertise in advanced model rocketry there are, you can select which area you want to learn more about. 

With having completed Level 2 of "Introduction to Advanced Model Rocketry" you have now unlocked the next level in the tree. 

Now, select the skill that sounds most interesting to you! 

- Physical Design
- Electronics Design
- Software Design
- Rocket Flight

## Level 3 - Getting to know Buffalo L
To see these areas in action, let's examine our latest rocket - Buffalo L. Buffalo L is a two-stage rocket aimed at achieving a propulsive landing similar to SpaceX. We launched the rocket four times. Here's a video of the first and second tests:
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2pJX37a3xG8?si=lkFb2OVsGc7qsmWE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

To achieve what you see in the second flight, we needed a CAD design, a flight computer, and software.

### CAD Design
### 3D Design
The first step in Buffalo L's development was its 3D design. I hand-drafted the rocket and its systems, then transformed these sketches into concrete models using a CAD design software. We brought them to life with our 3D printer and tested them, resolving design issues iteratively until finalizing the design. With Austria's most powerful available rocket engines being class D, weight constraints were immense. Consequently, we invented new, incredibly lightweight mechanisms and utilized engine clusters.

#### Ascent Stage
The ascent stage lifts the rocket to a sufficient altitude for the descent stage to perform a landing attempt. It incorporates a thrust vector control mount (TVC) for active stabilization using two servos controlling pitch and yaw axes. The ascent stage connects to Buffalo L via two stage connector bolts and a rubber band, which is severed by a heating wire for stage separation. After engine burnout, the stages separate, and the ascent stage parachute deploys.
![](KS®1235318379.34.jpg)


#### Descent Fins
Descent fins stabilize the rocket during free fall by lifting the center of pressure above the center of gravity. Two opposing fins, connected by a rubber band, deploy when a closing rubber band burns through after apogee.
![](KS®406702560.38.jpg)
#### Landing Legs
Landing legs, made of U-shaped aluminum rods, are attached to the landing leg attachment hull and pulled open by a rubber band. They are kept closed during ascent by an elastic band, which is severed to deploy the legs.
![](KS®12546936.40.jpg)
#### Landing TVC and TBS
The landing TVC operates like the ascent TVC but with a larger engine mount incorporating a thrust blocking system (TBS). The TBS uses a metal sliding plate to control thrust by aligning or misaligning a hole with the engine center. This allows for deceleration or acceleration by adjusting the exhaust path.
![](KS®12546936.46%201.jpg)
#### Backup Parachute
A backup parachute deploys if the rocket's height or orientation after ascent is unsuitable for a sequential landing attempt. Inspired by nature, the deployment system opens like a blossoming flower, ensuring reliable parachute release.
![](KS®12546936.47.jpg)
#### Structure
All modules connect using a bayonet coupling system with four plugs and sockets. Modules are rotated to connect and can be secured with small screws to prevent accidental rotation.
![](KS®1235332379.49.jpg)


### Flight Computer - Stack
Stack is our newest flight computer system. 
A flight computer has to carry out many different tasks and most often those are united on a single PCB. However, our design is highly modular and splits the tasks across three or more different boards.

Buffalo Stack: 
![](/assets/images/DSC00751-2.jpg)

One module runs the main flight software and handles telemetry, another one provides readily processed sensor data, and yet another controls the outputs.

Resulting in
- Stack CORE (upper module)
- Stack FUSION (middle module)
- Stack OUT (lower module)
#### Stack CORE
![](/assets/images/Buffalo%20Stack%20-%20Core.81.jpg)Stack CORE is always required. It is powered by a LiPo battery and features the power management for the entire flight computer system. Further, it bears functionality to store flight data and embeds connectivity.
#### Stack FUSION
![](/assets/images/Buffalo%20Stack%20%20-%20Fusion.82.jpg)
Then, there is Stack FUSION. Its task is to perform reliable state estimation and provide accurate position, velocity and attitude estimates to the CORE board for flight decisions and the control of active stabilization systems.
#### Stack OUT
![](/assets/images/Buffalo%20Stack%20-%20Out.83.jpg)The third board is the Buffalo OUT. This one incorporates pyro channels to trigger heating wires and electric ignitors, as well as servo ports to control the thrust vector control system.

#### Stack CONNECT
The boards interface with each other via a stackable header that we call Stack CONNECT.
Stack CONNECT, supplies battery voltage, regulated 5V, and regulated 3.3V from the CORE board to all the other sub-boards.

Through this connector, a total of 255 FUSION and OUT boards could be added to one CORE board, which makes its use cases almost endless.

### Operating System
The Buffalo L rocket features a fully functional operating system, refined over several flight tests, to achieve the ambitious goal of a propulsive landing.

The development of Buffalo L's software was the most time-consuming step, as it needed to handle multiple complex tasks:

- **Active Stabilization:** The rocket must maintain orientation during ascent and descent. This is achieved using gyroscope data and a PID algorithm.
    
- **Engine Ignition Timing:** The software includes a landing sequence simulation that determines the optimal engine ignition time for the descent stage by modeling free fall and powered descent phases.
    
- **Thrust Regulation:** During landing, the Thrust Blocking System (TBS) adjusts thrust to ensure a safe touchdown. The system iteratively calculates the necessary thrust percentage based on real-time data.

### Visualization - JM Eagle Control
![](/assets/images/Visualization%20GUI%20-%20JM%20Eagle%20Control%20-%20angles.jpg)

JM Eagle Control is our post-flight analysis tool. It allows us to reconstruct a flight using the data recorded by the flight computer. It visually represents all relevant information in an appealing and convenient way, with some representations being adjustable to fit specific needs.

This tool is invaluable for analyzing flights, identifying potential error sources, and improving the rocket's performance.
