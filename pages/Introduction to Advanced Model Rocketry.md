Prerequisite: Rocketree 
Estimated time: 1h

## Level 1 - Model Rocketry





## Level 2 - Advanced Model Rocketry 
Model rocket enthusiasts usually chose short burning rocket engines over longer burning ones, as this results in a very high TTWR. If this ratio is high enough, passive stabilization can be achieved by adding fins to the rear end of the rocket. How passive stabilization exactly works will be described in [Level 2  - Passively vs actively stabilized flight].

Real rockets, almost never solely utilize passive stabilization, as their TTWR is quite low at the beginning of the flight. Further, passive stabilization ceases to work in the upper layers of the atmosphere and allows for now active control. 

This is where advanced model rocketry comes into play. It tries to implement concepts, mechanisms, and systems that are used in the real aerospace industry. This results in more complex model rockets, enabling aerospace enthusiasts to learn the concepts of real rocketry while working at the affordable model rocket scale. 

An ambitious goal like this requires many more project aspects and skill sets than conventional model rockets do. These will be described in [Level 4 - Areas of expertise in Advanced Model Rocketry]
