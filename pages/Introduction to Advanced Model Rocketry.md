## Level 1 - Model Rocketry 
People all over the world are building and launching model rockets. 

In conventional model rocketry, a rocket must only accomplish two goals: reach a certain altitude and recover successfully. 

The reached altitude is largely dependent on the following three aspects: the engine, the weight, and the aerodynamic shape of the vehicle. In rocketry, these three aspects must be matched to the mission that should be accomplished.
### Weight
As you probably know there is a force that is acting on every object on Earth that is called the gravitational force. 

In its very basics form you might remember that it is calculated like this: 

$F_g = g * m$

$g \approx 9.81  \dfrac{m}{s^2}$ 

Where m is the mass and g is the local acceleration of free fall. 

This force must be overcome in order for the rocket to lift-off, and it is the primary impediment standing in our way to leave Earth. In fact, if it would have been even marginally higher, then escaping Earth would be impossible. On the other hand, if it would have been less, than life on Earth probably wouldn't have existed either. 

You might recognize that changing the local acceleration of free fall is impossible. So the only way to reduce the gravitational force, is to reduce the mass of the vehicle. This is why it is paramount in model and real rocketry **to make structures as light weight** as possible. 

In reality, the local acceleration is dependent on the location on Earth as well as the distance to the Earth's center of gravity. 

The approximation formula that was described above is derived from the following universal law: 
Between any two bodies of mass, there is a force that wants to attract the two bodies of mass to each other. 

The force can be calculation following  Newton's law of universal gravitation: 

$F = G*\dfrac{m_1*m_2}{r^2}$

$G = 6.67*10^{-11} \dfrac{m^3}{kg*s^2}$ ... Newtonian constant of gravitation 

This force depends on the masses of both bodies, as well as on the distance of the two bodies to each other. In most cases this effect can be neglected. However, Earth's and other Planet's mass is enormous. 

The formula also implies that the further our vehicle distances itself from Earth the less force it will have to overcome. 

### Drag 

We have been lucky that our planet come with an atmosphere that provides oxygen, regulates our planet's temperature, and protects us from solar radiation. 

Yet, when leaving Earth, it is the second obstacle that we have to overcome. 

Our atmosphere consists of gas and within this gas there are many different molecules. When travelling through our atmosphere our vehicle hits these molecules, and the faster our vehicle goes the more of these molecules it will hit at a certain time. These micro-hits will decelerate our vehicle, making it difficult to reach very fast speeds in our atmosphere. 

The force acting on our vehicle is calculated by the following formula:

$F_D = C_d*A*\dfrac{\rho * v^2}{2}$

It is dependent on 
- the density of the air, which will decrease with increased altitude. 
- the square of the speed with which our vehicle travels. 
- the area of our vehicle that faces in the direction of the speed. 
- and the drag coefficient $C_d$

Therefore, our rockets shall be designed in a way
- to reduce the front facing aera as much as possible. 
- and to feature an optimized aerodynamic shape to reduce the drag coefficient.

This is why most rockets, enclose all mechanisms, wires, and parts inside, feature smooth outisde surfaces, and have a cone-shaped rocket tip. 

### Stability



### Thrust

Conventional model rocketry â†’ passive stabilization (aerodynamic shape), and parachute deployment (mechanical system, or electronics system), sometimes data logger to estimate reached altitude. 
Most of the time only the aerodynamic shape is created 
Altitude largely depends on the used class of engines and the weight of the vehicle

This approach is very different to the real aerospace industry, and relatively easy to do.
