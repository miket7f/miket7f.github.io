Witnessing the newest missions of SpaceX, Nasa, and ESA, certainly inspired many people all over the world to become involved in aerospace engineering. 
### Model Rocketry 
However, for most participating in rocketry has long been very difficult to do. As many were either still in high school or already pursued another career. 

In recent years more and more miniaturized solid rocket engines became available all over the world through companies like ESTES, Apogee, or Klima. With those, aerospace enthusiasts were able to launch their own models in their spare time. Through the offering of model rocket engines, a new hobby evolved **Model Rocketry**.

The focus of model rocketry is
- to either buy a readily available model rocket or to physically design your own. 
- to equip them with a proper solid rocket engine. 
- and to come up with ideas on how to successfully recover their models. 

Model rocket enthusiasts usually choose short burning rocket engines over longer burning ones, as this results in a very high thrust to weight ratio. If this ratio is high enough, the rocket flies perfectly stable by adding fins to the rear end of the rocket. This effect is called passive stabilization.  

For recovering the model rockets, parachutes are incorporated. These can be deployed in many different way. One of the most common is to, for example, use the recoil of certain types of engines that release a gas after engine burnout. This gas creates pressure inside the parachute hull, which causes the nose cone to open. 

If the physical design of the rocket is done, the proper engine is selected, and the flight is simulated inside a software environment like Open Rocket. Then, there is nothing more to do, and it is time to launch the rocket.

### Real Rocketry

Conventional model rocketry, is certainly a fun endeavor and relatively easy to do. However, it has almost nothing to do with the real deal.

Real rockets never solely trust upon passive stabilization, as their thrust to weight ratio is quite low at the beginning of the flight. Further, passive stabilization ceases to work in the upper layers of the atmosphere and allows for now active control. 

For a rocket to escape Earth, it must enter Earth's orbit. Orbit insertion can only be done be knowing the orientation, position, and velocity of the vehicle, and by being able to control these parameters actively. 

To do so, electronics system, advanced software, and complex physical systems are incorporated inside each and every launch vehicle. 

### Advanced Model Rocketry
In **advanced model rocketry** the above mentioned concepts are implemented at the miniature scale, enabling aerospace enthusiasts to learn real aerospace concepts at an affordable scale.

With it the possibilities are endless, and there is no roof which could limit ambitious goals. BPS space, for example, simulated a Falcon Heavy flight with booster separation and active stabilization at the model rocket scale. While BPS space and TTB Aerospace both accomplished a propulsive landing just like SpaceX. Again other build the world's lightest thrust vector control model rocket (JM Space).
