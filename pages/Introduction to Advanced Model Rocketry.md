Prerequisite: Rocketree 
Estimated time: 1h
## Level 1 - Model Rocketry 
People all over the world are building and launching model rockets. 

In conventional model rocketry, usually a rocket must only accomplish two goals: reach a certain altitude and a recover successfully. 

The reached altitude is largely dependent on the following three aspects: the engine, the weight, and the aerodynamic shape of the vehicle. So, in conventional model rocketry, these three aspects must be matched to the mission that should be accomplished.
### Weight



### Thrust
### Drag & Stability 





Conventional model rocketry â†’ passive stabilization (aerodynamic shape), and parachute deployment (mechanical system, or electronics system), sometimes data logger to estimate reached altitude. 
Most of the time only the aerodynamic shape is created 
Altitude largely depends on the used class of engines and the weight of the vehicle

This approach is very different to the real aerospace industry, and relatively easy to do. 
## Level 2  - Passively vs actively stabilized flight


## Level 3 - Areas of expertise in Advanced Model Rocketry
