The material that we provide in the following levels is by now means complete but it might help you to learn about the subject yourself, while we are working on providing content for you! 

## Level 1 - Introduction to the Electronics Path

### Video Transcript 
We know, you are eager to develop your own flight computer right away. However, we have to get you set up with the fundamentals first. Trust me, I have been there, designing my first flight computer without caring about the fundamentals, and well I can tell you that my design didn't work out as planed. 

For you to get the best understanding of circuit design possible, we have to start all the way at the beginning. We will start within the atom and take a look on an even smaller unit - the electron. Then, we will zoom out and take a look on how multiple electrons interact with each other. We will learn about the force that acts between them, will describe what an electric field is, and look at the concept of electric charge. Further, we will learn about conductivity, electric potential and the concept of the electric current. 

You may wonder why we would want to understand all these theoretical concept first? 
Well, almost every electric circuit on Earth uses a combination of the following components, of which you might already have seen some. (Video of the components)
To understand any one of them, you have to be familiar with their underlying concepts. 
This one, for example, is called a resistor. To understand it, you have to know about electric current, voltage, and ohms law. 
If you use a set of multiple resistors, you will have to learn about Kirchhoff's laws. 
Then here we have a capacitor. To understand it you additionally will need to know about electric charge. 
Finally, to understand a diode and a transistor we will have to understand how p-n junctions function. 
## Level 2 - The Electron

#### The Atom
Our world, everything you see, consists of extremely tiny building blocks - the so called Atoms. Their name comes from the ancient Greek word Atomos, which stands for "uncuttable". Previously, they were thought to be undividable, but science has found out that they, in fact, consist of even smaller units. 

These units are called - protons, neutrons, and electrons. 
The protons are charged positively, the neutrons are neutral, and the electrons are charged negatively.

An atom can be divided into a core and a shell. The core or nucleus consists of the neutrons and protons and makes up more than 99% of the weight. The shell on the other hand consists of the electrons, and makes up the majority of the volume. As the neutrons aren't charged and the protons are charged positively, the net charge of the core is positive. 

You might know that similar charges repel each other, while opposing charges attract each other. 
This is why the electrons are attracted to the nucleus. 

However, you might wonder why the protons inside the nucleus do not repel each other? This is because there's another force present the so called nuclear force. This force is magnitudes higher than the electrostatic force, yet it only occurs at very small proximities like those found in the core.

#### Periodic Table
Each atom consists of at least one proton in the core. The number of protons in the core significantly changes the properties of the element. This is why humanity came up with a way of classifying those elements with the so called periodic table. An atom with one proton, for example, is referred to as hydrogen. An atom with two protons, on the other hand, is called helium. One with three protons, is lithium, and one with four is called beryllium. The number you can see in the upper left of the periodic table elements is the atomic number, which is equivalent to the number of protons in the core. 

#### Bohr's Model 
There are different models with which the layout of the atom can be described. One of the first and simplest description is the one of Rutherford and Bohr. 

In their model there are different shell layers. Each shell layer can only contain a specific number of electrons. This number increases with the shell number after the formula $2n^2$. This means that there can be a total of 2 electrons in the first shell, 8 electrons in the second shell, and 18 electrons in the third shell. The higher the shell number the higher the energy that can be stored in the shell. The shell with the lowest energy is always filled first. So the next shell layer is only opened when the previous layer is already full. Every atom wants to have a full outer shell layer of electrons. These outer shell electrons are called the valence electrons. 

Now let's take a look at the periodic table again. The row in the periodic table represents the number of shells each element has. So if an element is listed in row two, this means that it has a total of two shell layers. If it is listed in row three, it has three shell layers, and so on. The column of the periodic table represents how many electrons there are in the outer shell layer. This means that the elements on the far left have only one electron in the outer layer, while the ones in the far right have a full outer shell layer of electrons. The ones in the far right are called noble gases. This is the condition every element wants to achieve.  

The elements in the periodic table are also separated into different groups. In its basics there are non-metals and metals. Metals usually have relatively few valence electrons, while non-metals are usually rich in valence electrons.

This will be important to understand the concept of conductivity later on! 

#### Ions
In normal circumstances, each atom has as many electrons in the shell as protons in the core, which means that the net charge of the atom is neutral. However, if we add or remove an electron from the shell, we get a charged atom, a so called ion. An atom with added electron in the shell is net negatively charged, as the number of electrons is higher than the number of protons. This is called an anion. An atom with removed electrons, on the other hand, is positively charged. We call this a cation. 

#### Summary
So, our world consists of atoms, and these atoms consist of a core and a shell. The shell is filled with electrons, while the core is filled with protons and neutrons. The electrons are held in the shell by the attracting electrostatic force that occurs because of the opposing chargers of electrons and protons. The protons are held together by an even stronger force, the so called nuclear force. 

Depending on the number of protons you get different elements. There's the Bohr model which describes the shell of the atom to consist of layers, while the electrons that sit in the outer layer are called valence electrons. 

Further, there are ions, which result in through an imbalance between electrons and protons in a element. The atom can either be charged positively - cations,  negatively - anions, or it can be neutral.

#### Atom Bonding
To make up the materials that we know from our day to day life, atoms bond with each other to form something bigger. The can bond with each other through different forms. Metals, for example, bond with other metals through a metallic bond. Non-metals bond with each other through covalent bonds. And metals bond with non-metals through a ionic bond. 

To explain the concept of conductivity, we will only take a look on the third type of bond - the metallic bond. 

As you previously heard, every element wants to have a full outer shell layer. This means that non-metals usually want to receive electrons to fill up their outer layer, because their outer layer is already quite full. Metals on the other hand normally want to give up electrons, as there outer layer is quite empty and filling it up would be more difficult to do. 

Metals can achieve this state by bonding with each other through a metallic bond. When metals forms a metallic bond they give up their electrons in the outer layer. This means that the remaining atom are positively charged - cations. These cations would repel each other. However, the released electrons form a electron gas that fits between the cations. The positive cations and electrons attract each other, which causes the cations to form a regular structure. 

Because of this regularity, the metals receive their typical characteristics. Because of their bonding strength they are rigid bodies at room temperatures and have high boiling points. Further, they can be modified relatively easily through bending, forging, and so on. Each layer of cations in the rigid structure can be moved without destroying the bonds between them. 

#### Conductors
As most everyone knows, metals are good electrical conductors. Why this is the case, can be describe by looking at their structure. A conductor is a material in which electric current can flow. What exactly a current is will be discussed later, but in its basics electric current is the movement of charged matter. Metals are such good conductors, because the delocalized electrons can freely move between the cations. 

#### Summary
So, there are three different types of bonding 
- non-metals bond with non-metals covalently 
- non-metals bond with metals through an ionic bond
- and metals bond with metals through a metallic bond 

We look at the metallic bond in more detail to describe the properties of metals, such as conductivity.
