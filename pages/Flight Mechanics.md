Prerequisite: Level 2 - Introduction to Advanced Model Rocketry 

Before we can launch a rocket we must understand 
- the forces that occur in-flight
- and ways in which flight stability can be achieved
## Level 1 - Force and Moment 
Estimated time: 0 - 10h

If you have already learned about the concept of velocity, acceleration, force, and moment or torque in your physics or mechanics classes in school, then you can jump right to level 2. 

However, if you are uncertain about them and want to refresh your knowledge on them, you can do so in this level.
### Basics
The velocity is the change in distance per second. 
If we can assume that the velocity is constant then it can be calculated in the following way:

$v = \dfrac{s}{t}$
$s$ ... covered distance
$t$ ... elapsed time

Velocity is given in $\dfrac{meters}{second}$


Now if we assume, that the velocity is not constant, but changes by a constant factor, 
then we now that an acceleration is present. 

$a = \dfrac{v}{t}$
$v$ ... average velocity
$t$ ... elapsed time

Acceleration is given in $\dfrac{meters}{second^2}$

Here is an easy to understand video about the topic:

### Force
A force is an influence that can cause an object to change its velocity. 

It is calculated by:
$F=m*a$
$m$ ... mass 
$a$ ... acceleration 

You can think about it this way:
If you want to accelerate a certain body of mass m in vacuum with a certain acceleration a, then you will need to apply a certain force F. The larger the mass, the larger the force that you have to apply must be. Further, the faster you want to accelerate the body, the more force you must apply. 

The force is given in $\dfrac{kg*m}{second^2}$ or in $Newton$, as the concept of the force was first discovered by the physicist Isaac Newton. 

Here is an easy to understand video about the topic:

### Moment
A moment is the rotational analog of the force. 
It is calculated by:
$M=F*d$
$F$ ... force
$d$ ... distance

And given in $N*m$  ($Newton*meters$).

When calculating the moment, it is always around some kind of pivot point. 

This concept can be perfectly illustrated by looking at the seesaw in the picture. The pivot point is in the joint of the seesaw, and as you can see the further away the force is from the pivot point the larger the distance d. If you look at our formular, we can see that this means that if the force remained constant, that the moment increased in amount. 

So if a child sits on the seesaw, the moment it creates around the pivot point increases the further away from it it sits. This is why a kid with less weight than another kid can still pivot down the seesaw, if it sits further away from the pivot point. 

Here is an easy to understand video about the topic:

### Balance of Forces and Moments
In the mechanics chapter statics that is concerned with bodies that are not moving, there is something called the balance of forces and moments. 

For a body to not move, there must be no resulting force acting on it. This means, that if there is a force acting on the body, that there must always be a counterforce for the body to not move. 

For example, when we take a apple sitting on a table, we might assume that there is a resulting force aiming towards Earth's center, the so called gravitational force. However, if this would be the case, the apple would accelerate downwards toward the center. This is certainly the case if the apple falls from a tree, but as soon as it hits a surface, it will remain stationary. 

This can be explained, as there is actually an invisible force that the table creates on the apple that is exactly counter directional to the gravitational force. This means that the total force is zero. 
If we take this concept further, this also must mean that all bodies that are stationary, must have a total force of zero. This means that, if we know the size and direction of a certain force and do not know the size and direction of another force, that we can calculate them based on this principle. 

Here is an easy to understand video about the topic:
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C8N4REG8ISE?si=e9rUrNxp6bz-Y8VG" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

A similar principle applies to a body that is not rotating. Only this time, the total moment on the body must be zero. 

Let's take the seesaw example again and assume that there are two children sitting on it with one being slightly heavier than the other. The lighter kid sights slightly further away from the pivot point. Further, lets assume that the seesaw is perfectly balanced, and does not tilt. 

This means that the total moment on the seesaw most be zero, which means that the moment created by the lighter child is the same as the moment created by the slightly heavier child. 
If there is no tilting on the seesaw, the moments must be in balance!

### Activity 1
A man runs at a constant speed and needs 5s to cover a distance of 30m.
What is the speed of the man?

Now, we assume that the man starts at a velocity of 0m/s and accelerates constantly over the entire distance. He still needs 5s to cover the 30m. 
How fast is the man accelerating? 

Further, we know that the man has 75kg. 
What is the force the man must apply to achieve the acceleration calculated above?

### Activity 2
There is a seesaw with a child siting 2m away from the pivot point. The child has a mass of 25kg. Assume that the gravitational acceleration is approximately 10m/s^2. 
What is the moment on the seesaw? 

### Activity 3
An concrete block with a mass of 175kg sits still on a lawn.  
What must be the invisible force the lawn applies to the concrete block? 

### Activity 4
Two children sit on a seesaw across each other.
Child 1 has a mass of 25kg an sits 2m away from the pivot point
Child 2 has a mass of 20kg.
At what distance must child 2 sit in order for the pivot point to be balanced and to not experience a total moment? 

## Level 2 - Flight Forces 
Estimated time: 2h

The reached altitude is largely dependent on the following three aspects: the engine, the weight, and the aerodynamic shape of the vehicle. These aspects must be matched to each other for a rocket flight to be successful. 

### Weight
As you probably know there is a force that is acting on every object on Earth that is called the gravitational force. 

In its very basics form you might remember that it is calculated like this: 

$F_g = g * m$

$g \approx 9.81  \dfrac{m}{s^2}$ 

Where m is the mass and g is the local acceleration of free fall. 

This force must be overcome in order for the rocket to lift-off, and it is the primary impediment standing in our way to leave Earth. In fact, if it would have been even marginally higher, then escaping Earth would be impossible. On the other hand, if it would have been less, than life on Earth probably wouldn't have existed either. 

You might recognize that changing the local acceleration of free fall is impossible. So the only way to reduce the gravitational force, is to reduce the mass of the vehicle. This is why it is paramount in model and real rocketry **to make structures as light weight** as possible. 

In reality, the local acceleration is dependent on the location on Earth as well as the distance to the Earth's center of gravity. 

The approximation formula that was described above is derived from the following universal law: 
Between any two bodies of mass, there is a force that wants to attract the two bodies of mass to each other. 

The force can be calculation following  Newton's law of universal gravitation: 

$F = G*\dfrac{m_1*m_2}{r^2}$

$G = 6.67*10^{-11} \dfrac{m^3}{kg*s^2}$ ... Newtonian constant of gravitation 

This force depends on the masses of both bodies, as well as on the distance of the two bodies to each other. In most cases this effect can be neglected. However, Earth's and other Planet's mass is enormous. 

The formula also implies that the further our vehicle distances itself from Earth the less force it will have to overcome. 

### Drag 
We have been lucky that our planet come with an atmosphere that provides oxygen, regulates our planet's temperature, and protects us from solar radiation. 

Yet, when leaving Earth, it is the second obstacle that we have to overcome. 

Our atmosphere consists of gas and within this gas there are many different molecules. When travelling through our atmosphere our vehicle hits these molecules, and the faster our vehicle goes the more of these molecules it will hit at a certain time. These micro-hits will decelerate our vehicle, making it difficult to reach very fast speeds in our atmosphere. 

The force acting on our vehicle is calculated by the following formula:

$F_D = C_d*A*\dfrac{\rho * v^2}{2}$

It is dependent on 
- the density of the air, which will decrease with increased altitude. 
- the square of the speed with which our vehicle travels. 
- the area of our vehicle that faces in the direction of the speed. 
- and the drag coefficient $C_d$

Therefore, our rockets shall be designed in a way
- to reduce the front facing aera as much as possible. 
- and to feature an optimized aerodynamic shape to reduce the drag coefficient.

This is why most rockets, enclose all mechanisms, wires, and parts inside, feature smooth outside surfaces, and have a cone-shaped rocket tip. 

### Thrust
Now we know which forces will act on our vehicle. 
In order for the vehicle to lift-off, these forces must be overcome by the thrust force that the rocket engine creates. 

In the case of model rockets, solid rocket motor are used. These are comparable to the engine of a fireworks rocket. Once they are ignited, they burn until no full is left. 

#### Engine Classification
These engines are bought online and for every engine three characterisitics are usually given: thrust, burn time, and the thrust curve. 

The thrust indicates the average force the rocket engine will provide. Logically, this force shall be greater than the gravitational force that acts on the vehicle. 

The burn time indicates for how long the rocket motor will burn, which together with the thrust largely determines the altitude that can be reached with a certain engine. 

And finally, there is the thrust curve that represents the thrust over the burn time to gain an understanding on how the thrust of the engine will change over the burn duration. 

The area under the thrust curve is the total impulse. According to the total impulse solid rocket engines are classified from A all the way up to O.  The higher the letter in the alphabet the higher the total impulse will be. 

An A-class engine, for example, has a total impulse between 1.26 to 2.5 Ns.
There are multiple ways for a solid rocket engine to classify as A. 
An engine that has thrust of 2.5 Newton for 1 second for example has the same total impulse, as an engine that has thrust of 1 Newton and burns for 2.5 seconds. 

Still it is important which engine to chose, because with one of them the rocket might lift-off, while with the other, the gravitational force would be too high. 

#### Thrust to Weight Ratio
This is where the thrust to weight ratio (TTWR) comes into play. 

$TTWR = \dfrac{F_t}{F_g}$

It indicates the ratio between the gravitational force to the thrust of the rocket engine. 
If it is larger than one, the rocket is expected to lift off, and the higher the ratio is the faster the vehicle will accelerate. 

### Activity 1
Calculate the gravitational force that is acting on the Apollo lunar lander standing on the Moon. 

$m_{Lander} = 14,696 kg$
$m_{Moon}= 7.35*10^{22} kg$
$r_{Moon} = 1,737.4km$

### Activity 2
Select the class of the solid rocket engine that would be required for the lunar lander to be able to hoover above the ground. Assume a burn time of around 1 second. 

| Engine Class | Total impulse [Ns] |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| M            | 5,120 - 10,240     |
| N            | 10,240 - 20,480    |
| O            | 20,480 - 40,960    |
| P            | 40,960 - 81920     |
## Level 3 - Flight Stability
Estimated time: 2h
After the first level, we are aware of the most essential forces acting on our vehicle during flight: weight, drag, and thrust. Further, we learned about engine classification and TTWR. 

Now, let's assume the following scenario:
We have selected the right engine, have a vehicle that is light weight enough to lift-off and have created a low air-resistance aerodynamic shape. 
You might think that this rocket will reach the expected altitude in a picture perfect manner. 
However, this is not necessarily the case, as we did not yet take rocket stability into the equation. All the aspects we just mentioned could be on point, but if our rocket won't fly stable it also wont reach its expected altitude and might even be seriously damaged. 

Here is an example of a unstable model rocket launch: 
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vI4dGQMHmaY?si=6JsOmFrG44YRkeIM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

For us to understand flight stability, we must first discuss two important concepts: 
- Center of gravity (COG)
- and center of pressure (COP)
### Center of gravity
![](/assets/images/Pasted%20image%2020240511071551.png)
As we discussed earlier, every mass on Earth experiences a gravitational force.
If we know the mass, we also know the force.
But where does the force apply?

In the center of gravity!
For the rocket illustrated above there is exactly one point (blue) in which the resulting gravitational force of the entire vehicle applies. 

The rocket is perfectly balanced around this point. If you would hold it in the COG, the rocket would neither tip forward nor backward. 

The center of gravity, sometimes also called center of mass, is also the point around which the rocket will rotate during flight. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass#Center_of_gravity
### Center of pressure
Before you can know whether your rocket will be stable, you have to determine the center of pressure (COP).

COP is the point at which the resulting drag force of your vehicle will apply. 

This point can be approximated by calculating the centroid of each area. 
In the illustration above, we would calculate the centroid of the ellipsoid shape of the nose cone, the rectangle of the rocket body, and the two ellipsoid shapes of the rear end. 
Then, we would add them together to get the centroid of the total area, which is approximately where the drag force would apply. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_pressure_(fluid_mechanics)

### Passive stability
![](/assets/images/rocket-stability-diagram.png)

With the interplay between the gravitational force, the drag force, and the two points at which they apply (COG/COM and COP), we can determine the rocket stability.

In the first picture the rocket flies perfectly stable, as it is moving along its axis of symmetry. In this case the drag force is perfectly inline with the gravitational force. Both point perfectly downward and are in the symmetry axis of the rocket. Therefore, no torque will be created around the center of gravity - remember this is the point around which the rocket rotates!. 

In the second and third picture, the rocket is no longer moving along its axis of symmetry and is offset by a displacement angle. This time, the drag force does not align with the gravitational force. Therefore, the to the symmetry axis normal part of the drag force will create a moment around the center of gravity. 

In the third picture, where the center of gravity is behind the center of pressure, the moment turns the rocket's symmetry axis further away from its direction of motion.

In the second picture, the center of gravity is in front of the center of pressure. Here, the moment causes the rocket to turn inwards so the symmetry axis aligns more closely with the direction of motion. 

In the third picture the moment would cause the rocket to become unstable, while in the second picture the same moment would cause the rocket to passively stabilize itself. 

Here is a short video to get a better understanding of this concept: 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H0uI2ab52DE?si=BxVhyr2O4vzXRvdw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
### Fins
The center of pressure shall be behind the center of gravity for a stable ascent, and the further apart these two are the more stable the configuration will be. 
But how can we achieve this? 

The most obvious solution, would be to bring the center of gravity as much forward as possible. However, this is alone will be difficult to do. The heaviest part of the model rocket is the engine, sitting at the rear end of the rocket. So, naturally the center of gravity is further behind than the center of pressure. To counteract, we could use a heavy parachute system, or add weights to the nose cone. But, as you can image this is something that we, as aerospace engineers clearly would not like to do.

Another solution, would be to bring the center of pressure as much backward as possible. This can be done by adding surfaces to the rear end of the rocket through which the centroid of the entire area shifts backward. These rear end surfaces are called **fins**.

There are many different sizes and shapes of fins. In general, the larger the fin area the further the center of pressure will move backwards. 
#### Speed
A final aspect we must take into the equation of passive stabilization is velocity. 

The higher the TTWR ratio, the higher the velocity in any flight phase will be. 
For passive stabilization this is highly beneficial, as a higher velocity also means a higher drag force. A higher drag force, in turn means a higher restoring moment on the vehicle. An as you might remember the drag force is dependent of the square of the velocity. So, marginal increases in TTWR can significantly influence the stability of your rocket. 

$F_D = C_d*A*\dfrac{\rho * v^2}{2}$

### Activity 1
Is this rocket configuration stable?
![](/assets/images/Pasted%20image%2020240511082924.png)
- 15cm nose cone
- 50cm tube length 
- 10cm diameter 
- 15cm from the left is the COG

![](/assets/images/Pasted%20image%2020240511083349.png)
If not determine the length of one side of the quadrat fin to create a stable configuration?
- quadrat fins
- four fins in total

## Level 4 - Active Stabilization
Estimated time: 2h

In conventional model rocketry, flight stability is most often achieved by the means of passive stabilization.

However, there a number of other ways with which an stable flight can be achieved. 

For example, with active stabilization. 
An actively stabilized rocket features a system that achieves stability with an effect other than the one described above. For a rocket stabilized with an active system, it is not necessarily required that the center of gravity is in front of the center of pressure. Most often rockets equipped with active stabilization, would be unstable without their stabilization system. 

Active stabilization can take many forms, and most often adds control to the vehicle, such as the ability to control pitch and yaw vehicle.
### Thrust Vector Control
One way to actively stabilize a rocket is thrust vector control. In this approach the engine is vectored to the rocket body. This is one of the most wide-used approaches of active stabilization in the industry. 


![](/assets/images/7089805_orig.png)

Normally, the rocket engine is perfectly inline with the symmetry axis of the rocket (second picture). Therefore, the rocket engine does not create a moment around the COG. 

When the rocket's symmetry axis is out of sync with the direction of motion. The thrust vector control systems gimbals and moves the thrust force out of the symmetry axis of the rocket. 
The normal component of the thrust force to the symmetry axis creates a moment around the COG. The effect of this moment is similar to the restoring moment described in the passive stabilization method. 

Here is a video demonstrating how it works: 
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mfP23FW-2pQ?si=wp2yYYCy7p2OurTA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

And here is an article about it:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust_vectoring

Compared to passive stabilization, thrust vectoring comes with a several benefits.

First, it not only works at fast velocities, but also at very low TTWRs, as the created moment is dependent on the thrust force and not on the drag force. 

Second, a resulting moment can also be created when the rocket flies perfectly stable. This way, the rocket's pitch and yaw orientation can be controlled. Precise pitch and yaw control, also allows for position and vertical velocity control. 

Third, it works in space, as it does not require air resistance but only the force of the rocket engine. 

However, thrust vectoring comes also with a disadvantage. It only works, as long as the rocket engine provides thrust. So, after engine burnout, this system stops working and other active stabilization systems must take over if control after engine burnout is crucial for the success of the mission. 
### Prerequisites for TVC to work
Another "disadvantage" is the complexity of a TVC system, as it requires the interplay of many different aspects for it to work.

#### Determination of Orientation
First, the rocket must utilize a flight computer to be able to evaluate the current orientation of the vehicle. If the rocket does not know how it is currently oriented, it will also not be able to determine how it must gimbal its engine to create the appropriate restoring moment. 

#### Control Algorithm 
Second, the rocket's operating system must incorporate some kind of control algorithm. As soon as the flight computer determines an offset in the desired orientation, this algorithm must come up with the ideal gimbal angle of the engine to restore the rocket to the desirable orientation. 

If it would gimbal too much, the rocket orientation would overshoot, and if it gimbaled too little, the rocket would not reach the desired orientation. 

#### TVC system
Third, now the flight computer knows what orientation it has, what orientation it wants to have, and what the angle of the engine shall be. 

However, it also needs a system that can vector the engine appropriately. This system must come with little to no play, with fast actuating speeds, and with enough structural rigidity to withstand the engine force. 

#### Conclusion 
Only if all three aspects
- orientation evaluation 
- control algorithm
- and TVC system 

work together seamlessly, active stabilization with thrust vectoring can be achieved. 
As soon as one of them fails, the rocket will lose stability. 

## Level 5 - Other Stabilization Methods 
Estimated time: 1h

Of course there are more ways to stabilize a rocket. 
In this level, you will learn about three more ways in which you could do so. 
### Gyroscopic Effect 
A second way to passively stabilize a rocket is by using the gyroscopic effect. 

The gyroscopic effect describes the tendency of a spinning body to maintain a steady direction in the axis of its rotation:
https://www.mechnflow.com/post/gyroscope-and-it-s-effect#:~:text=Gyroscopic%20effect%20is%20ability%20

This effect can be utilized, by implementing a flywheel inside the rocket that spins around the roll axis. As long as this fly wheel spins, the roll axis has the tendency of wanting to remain steady, which means that during flight the rocket wants to remain upright. 
### Reaction Control System
The second way of actively stabilizing a rocket is by using thrusters on the rear and front end of the vehicle. 

These thrusters are able to release gas. Depending on the system this gas can either be a hot or cold gas. The gas-release, repels the vehicle in the opposing direction, and depending on the gas impulse length and strength the orientation of the vehicle can be controlled.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_control_system

This system consists of a 
- pressurized gas tank filled with, for example, CO2 or nitrogen 
- several valves 
- pressure wiring 
- and nozzles.

Especially, the gas tank and the valves make this system upmost difficult to realize in a miniature scale rocket. Small valves are very rare and if one manages to acquire some, they are either heavy, bad quality, or medical grade expensive. 

Still, it is a cool concept to learn about and to keep in mind. 

Here is a video about this concept from BPS space:
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/10Pdl0Omet8?si=_YGA20P6WS4RcP0g" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Moveable Fins
The third way to actively stabilize a rocket is by using steerable fins. 

This is a way of combining passive stabilization with active control. However, it comes with similar disadvantages as passive fin stabilization, as it only works in the atmosphere, won't work in space, and best works at high TTWR ratios. 

In essence it works by tilting the fins at the rear end of the rocket. 
By tilting the fins, the area of the fin in the direction of motion increases, which simultaneously increases the amount of drag. If we are looking at the front view of the rocket, the center of pressure wanders outside the center of the rocket body, which creates a moment about the pitch or yaw axis. 

Usually, a four fin design is chosen. 
By tilting two opposing fins in a way so they both face in the same direction, the pitch or the yaw axis can be controlled.  Additionally, by tilting all fins by the same amount, the roll axis of the vehicle can be controlled. 

If roll, pitch, and yaw shall be controlled at the same time, it is very difficult to do as the interplay between those three motions is hard to grasp. Further, the amount of tilt required to control the rocket depends on the flying speed. So, the vehicle must accurately determine its speed in real time, and then adjust the fin tilt amount by the correct value. To get this kind of active stabilization right, an enormous amount of simulation work must be done beforehand. 

Here is an example of a someone that achieved stabilization with fin control: 
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/man5ag8Jl6s?si=aTpGdq9E9EB-LSCz" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Activity 1

- active control possible
- still stable without engine thrust 
- simulation intensive

Method 2:
- functional in vacuum
- usable without engine thrust 

Method 3:
