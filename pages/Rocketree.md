You are interested in space, electronics, computer aided design, control theory, or technology in general? You want to launch a model rocket, develop your own, or are eager to learn about it? 

Then, let us introduce you to our skill-based learning environment - **Rocketree**.

Rocketree is everything you need to get your own rocketry project going! It was crafted from over five years of experience in model rocket development, envisioned from aerospace engineering students for aerospace enthusiasts. 

Rocketree is here to revolutionize how students, enthusiasts, and makers learn. With it, learning will be fun and not a burden.

Learning with Rocketree works similar to upgrading your character in a video game. You start at the trunk of the tree, where you will acquire the most fundamental knowledge about aerospace and model rocketry. But then, the tree splits into branches. This means that you can explore whatever topic you are currently interested in and aren't limited to a pre-defined learning experience. 

For every skill of the tree, there are also levels. So you can decide, whether you want to explore loads of different skills and topics to gain a broad understanding of model rocketry, or whether you want to master a certain skill and to do a deep dive. In fact, after working with Rocketree for a while, your tree will be uniquely yours and almost not tree will look alike.  

You can decide whether you want to fly a model rocket, analyze past flights, design your own rocket, make your own flight computer extension, handle sensor readouts, or program your own control algorithms. And if all of that sounds so exciting that you want to do all of them at once, then you certainly can with Rocketree.
