## Level Specific Description

### Level 0 - Intro to the Electronics Path
Welcome to the first episode of our flight computer design course! In this series, we'll guide you through a comprehensive journey covering a wide range of topics, from atomic theory to PCB design. For a detailed overview of the exact content, please see the table below. 

The course is divided into 40 videos, totaling 5 hours of content. Best of all, the first 1 hour and 30 minutes of the course is completely free! 

Starting now, we will upload one episode per week until all the videos in the Electronics Fundamentals section are available. Join us, and by the end of the course, you will be able to design and order your own flight computer. 

### Level 4 - Voltage
Now we know that electrons can flow inside a metal and that the flow rate is called electric current but not why the movement occurs. The invisible force that pushes the electrons from one battery pole into the other is called voltage. This definition is simplistic and describes what the voltage does. However, it does not tell as how it is defined. The voltage is defined as the difference in *electric potential* between two points. After this lecture, you'll understand this definition and the concept of voltage more thoroughly.

### E System Overview - Level 1 
In this episode, we explore what a typical flight computer system might look like. We discuss how to break down a flight computer into various sub-units, including power management, the microcontroller, sensors, outputs, and telemetry. This overview sets the stage for the detailed description of flight computer circuits we will delve into over the next 25 episodes and more than 3h 30min of content. Note: This is the last video of this series that we will publish on YouTube. To access the remaining videos, head to our RockeTree learning platform. https://rocketree-quasar.vercel.app/
